Hey there

How’s it going? Glad you landed here.
I’m Ayushman Singh,
A computer science student at VIT Bhopal. I spend a good chunk of my time learning and experimenting with my ideas, trying to turn them into working projects that make sense in real life.

Beyond Engineering-
Life isn’t just about coding for me. I love athletics, singing, and honestly… food (yes, eating is a real hobby for me). These things keep me grounded, make me happy, and give me new energy to get back to work.

A Thought I Live By-
People often ask, “Where do you see yourself in the next 3–4 years?”
Truth is, I don’t really buy into that. Life isn’t a straight line—you never know what tomorrow brings. So instead of mapping out years ahead, I try to focus on today: learning something new, finishing what I start, and making the present meaningful.

Skills
Programming: Python, Java

My Goal
Not a big, shiny goal—just a simple one: keep learning, keep building, and stay consistent. I believe that’s what really shapes where life takes you.
